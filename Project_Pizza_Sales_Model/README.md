In this Powerbi Project we have  analyze the data and put together a report to help us find opportunities to drive more sales and work more efficiently.
Things are going OK here at Plato's, but there's room for improvement.We've been collecting transacl data for the past year, but really haven't been able to put it to good use. 


Here are some questions that we solved in this project:

Q1 What days and times do we tend to be busiest?

Q2 How many pizzas are we making during peak periods?

Q3 What are our best and worst-selling pizzas?

Q4 What's our average order value?

Q5 what is the month over month sales change of pizza?

Q6 Monthwise analysis of profit.
